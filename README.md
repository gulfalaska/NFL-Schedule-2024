This is the frist project i've ever done with pyhton all it does is open a GUI and display a scrolling set of Logos of NFL teams based on weekly matchups for the 2024 season.
I would love for others to add functinality to the code and make ot do other things i plan on tring to add records a time based functionality to display games based on their start times and other things.
I am using this project to just learn how to use pycharm as well as github but please provide any feedback or suggestions of ideas you would like to see.
